# * OVERVIEW
<p>Roommate Quest is an application for people looking for a roommate.  Users, looking for a room or a roommate, can create their accounts, describe themselves and post a picture with a headline.
Even, when there are many "roommate" apps out there, It doesn't mean that we can add one more.
</p>
<p>
I used React JS, Nodemon, MongoDB for the database and npm library "Nuka-Carousel"
</p>

# GROUP MEMBERS
<p> I decided to create this app on my own. I wanted to challenge and prove to myself what I learned during the 6 months Coding Bootcamp. At the end I was able to meet the challenge and feel a great sense of accomplishment - by the way, I was able to learn a lot more about React JS during the process.
</p>

# SCHEDULE FOR COMPLETION OF VARIOUS TASKS
<p> Even when I had a general schedule of the project, I wasn't able to follow it because I confronted many challenges along the process of building the app.
