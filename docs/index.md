# OVERVIEW
<p>
Roommate Quest is an application for people looking for a roommate. Users, looking for a room or a roommate, can create their accounts, describe themselves and post a picture with a headline. Even, when there are many "roommate" apps out there, It doesn't mean that we can add one more.

I used React JS, Nodemon, MongoDB for the database and npm library "Nuka-Carousel"

# GROUP MEMBERS
<p>
I decided to create this app on my own. I wanted to challenge and prove to myself what I learned during the 6 months Coding Bootcamp. At the end I was able to meet the challenge and feel a great sense of accomplishment - by the way, I was able to learn a lot more about React JS during the process.

# SCHEDULE FOR COMPLETION OF VARIOUS TASKS
<p>
Even when I had a general schedule of the project, I wasn't able to follow it because I confronted many challenges along the process of building the app.

# SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ISSUES
<p>
I had multiple issues facing every single deadline. One of these issues was the computer speed. The computer need extra memory space and I was not able to add it, resulting in very long waits for the project to be done. Another issue I faced was the creation the REACT APP at the begining, resulting in the creation of multiple projects. At the end I decided to use one of the class projects (AjaxBooks) and build from there. Unfortunatelly, this same action caused me some issues with Heroku and I haven't been able to fix the issue as of now.
</p>

<p>
I did the whole project,but I have to recognize the help from the Ta's and my tutor. It was impossible to have it done without their guide. 
</p>

<p>
As I mentioned, I still have to fix the issue to deploy to Heroku. I decided to shrink the functionalities, so I could have a practical app and working as required. I would like to add more things, including a better UI, but as long as the problem to deploy to Heroku continues,I won't be able to focus on those extra things that I originally wanted for the project.
